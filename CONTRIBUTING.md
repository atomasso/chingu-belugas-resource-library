We found it to be difficult to manage both collecting and organizing our resources in one go. 
Adding new resources becomes a pain because we first need to chase down the ever changing organization on this repository.
We faced broken links and 404's because of this. 
In order to make this project more streamlined, we decided to change how we go on. 
We will do this project in several stages:

# Stage 1 - **Current Stage**

## *Main focus - Collecting all the resources and having them in one place.*

* Add the resources posted by Beluga members **only** into the readme.md. 
* We will have tentative categories that will be revised at a later stage. 
* If you do not see appropriate category, you can create it
* Please do not add new folders, and do not add to the existing files. 

#Stage 2 

## *Main focus - Organization*

* Contribution guidelines will be added once we reach this stage
